Use the Split words function to split words so they can be timed 
individually.

Use the Combine words function to recombine highlighted words into 
sentences. (for making enhanced SRT). For now, combining only works as
enhanced SRT, but other options are coming.

The Export LRC function does not work at this point, but coming soon.
