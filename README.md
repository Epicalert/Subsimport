# Subsimport
Blender 3d addon for importing and editing subtitle and lyric files.

A panel is added to the right of the sequencer. Set the channel where the subtitles will be added and the font size that will be applied to the subtitles after import. Use the buttons to import .srt, .lrc, or .txt files. An option is also given for exporting LRC files (blender already has a function for exporting .srt files) 

When preparing a text file for import, it is recommended that all line lengths should be 74 characters or less.

After importing you may use the D and F keys to quickly edit the text strips.
